Hey there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Veli Ã–mÃ¼r Turan**. I use both of my names. Feel free to use whichever you can pronounce easier.

I'm a Software Engineer at [Delivery Hero](https://www.deliveryhero.com/) and I'm currently located in **Berlin, Germany** ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª I've developed and maintained projects in many different languages but **JavaScript** is my comfort zone. At the moment, I'm working with **Golang**.

Apart from technical topics, I'd like to talk and get better at "human problems" of working places, specifically about diversity and inclusion.

I'm currently learning the piano ðŸŽ¹  and roller-skating â›¸. Both involve a lot of frustration but fun.

You can follow me on Twitter: [@omurturan](https://twitter.com/omurturan). I tweet about random stuff and it is mostly in Turkish.
